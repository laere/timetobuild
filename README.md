# timetobuildnewthings

New to coding. I've dabbled in HTML/CSS in the past and created a few web pages.
I tried things like Python/Ruby and it just didn't click for me. However,
I have picked up JS, and am loving it. It's easy yet pretty difficult and overwhelming at the same time.

Hoping to continue to build things to help myself learn, and to learn from others. I would really love to make
this into a career, so I will be spending a majority of my time learning and building stuff!
